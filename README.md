# TaskMaster 

Welcome to the TaskMaster Application repository! This application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack and allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their to-do items.
Additionally, users can filter the to-do items based on their status (e.g., "To-Do", "In Progress", "Done").

# Features

**Create**: Add new to-do items.
**Read**: View all to-do items.
**Update**: Edit existing to-do items.
**Delete**: Remove to-do items.
**Filter**: Filter to-do items based on their status.
